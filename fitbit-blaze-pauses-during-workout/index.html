<p><strong>Fitbit Blaze Pauses During Workout</strong>, Blaze through the drawstring of my boardshorts and that seem worked but no heart rate reading during my workout.

Fitbit Blaze Faq Everything You Need To Know Imore From imore.com</p>
<p>Had a Fitbit charge 2 and was generally happy with it. I continued to juggle the two trackers until this past weekend when I ran a 5k and the only thing the Blaze. I just got a Versa as a gift and I am finding that during run workouts the app just randomly pauses. It was such a problem I had to go back to the Charge HR during those workouts. I had the exact same problem - Blaze pausing during kickboxing.</p>
